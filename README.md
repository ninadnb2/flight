Libraires Used-
1.Numpy
2.Pandas
3.matplotlib
4.seaborn
5.sklearn

Steps performed-
1.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):- Performed EDA on data to understand relationships among columns by using univariate,bi-variate and multi-variate analysis.

2.Data Visualization:- Generated graphs to understand pattern in data

3.Feature Engineering- This is important step.We only need those columns which will be helpful for prediction.

4.Spliting dataset- Dataset was divided into train and test data.

5.Model Building- ML algorithms were applied to generate predictions.

Algorithms used- 
1.Ridge regression
2.Lasso regression
3.Decision tree 
4.Random forest

Conclusion-By comparing all the models (Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor), we can conclude that Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor performs the best.
